# face_generation_DCGAN
n this tutorial, new face images will be produced using the Facial Expression Recognition (FER2013) dataset. Since this data set includes different emotional states, the data diversity is quite high. This is positive for GAN training. However, since not all photos are taken from the same angle, the success of face production may be affected.
